As a full stack web developer, I bring a well-rounded skill set that covers both front-end and back-end development:

Front-End Development: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with experience in frameworks and libraries like React and Angular. I create responsive, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces with a focus on modern design principles and optimal performance.

Back-End Development: Skilled in Node.js and Express, with a solid understanding of RESTful API design. I build efficient, scalable server-side logic to ensure that applications run smoothly.

Database Management: Experienced in both relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). I work with data modeling, query optimization, and data security to ensure reliable and secure data handling.

Version Control and Collaboration: Proficient with Git and GitHub for version control, allowing smooth collaboration in team environments. I use Git's branching and merging capabilities to manage codebases effectively.

Other Tools & Technologies: Familiar with Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines, enabling smooth deployment and integration processes. I also use testing frameworks like Jest and Mocha to ensure code reliability.
<br>
Projects:
<br>
Project 1: A responsive e-commerce site with a modern UI, secure authentication, and real-time cart updates.
<br>
Project 2: A social media platform with features like user profiles, direct messaging, and activity feeds.
<br>
Project 3: A task management app with an intuitive dashboard, task categorization, and team collaboration tools.
